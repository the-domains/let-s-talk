**Bringing friends together.**

Yesterday we were invited to a birthday
party, a double 40 th. It was nice to get together with some friends
we haven't seen for a while. We ate, drank and laughed and all the time I kept
thinking- why is it that we spend so little time with people we like? Daily
trot is the killer. Some of the people at the party were my husband's
ex-colleagues. All of them complained that they were stressed out juggling
work, kids and other responsibilities. How these things were like a swamp: the
more you do, the deeper you sink. Shouldn't it be the other way around? I
agreed, having talked with them hasn't changed a thing in my own hurricane
lifestyle, but felt noticeably better, not being the only looser. One more
thing transpired -- we all live in the same city, some just a few blocks away
from one another, but never manage to meet regularly anyway. Not seeing how
this can change in the near future, whit our assorted problems in the way of
social interchange, I have decided to start this website in an attempt to
repair what's left of our social life, with a hope of expanding it some more.
After all, I might add, that among my friends there are some remarkable people.
I have been blessed with the opportunity to know some real gems of
entrepreneurs, scholars (or both), talented cooks, great parents, clever
storytellers, real crafty-pants and worshippers at the pantheon of beauty,
internal and external.

Hoping they all will benefit from this
cross-friendship of value and new friends are always welcome here. 

So guys, come, join our little big world of
friendship and feel free to contribute to our round table conversations. It's
always fun to be around good friends. You are welcome to post your thoughts,
ideas and business ads. After all, nothing spreads faster than word of mouth
advertising between people who really know and trust each other. If friends
don't support each other, then who will?

I see this site as a means of bringing our
existing friendship on a lasting level. As a means to developing links between
so many wonderful people I was lucky to get to know in my life, and still hope
to meet, and may be bringing us together with a view of broadening our
horizons. So let's do it. Let's talk.
